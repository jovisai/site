        <div class="ui-layout-column-6">
          <p>&quot;Jovis News&quot; app is built by Muthukrishnan for his own usage and then made public for everyone.
          </p>
          <p>The app collects no data, personal or device related. Everything you add in the app, your bookmarks,
            history and your preferences are all stored in the device itself.</p>
          <p>The artificial intelligence in this app is only to curate high quality news, summarize and present it to
            the users without knowing anything about them.</p>
          <p><strong>Data recovery</strong></p>
          <p>If you lose the device, the data is lost along with it. There is no way to recover it as everything in stored in the device itself.</p>
          <p><strong>Log Data</strong></p>
          <p>No logs are collected from the user device for me to do any analysis. Its a dead simple app which basically
            shows news based on the keywords added by you.</p>
          <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
          <p>No cookies needed by this app. The API calls I make to fetch news are based on the keywords alone, so I
            don&#39;t need any user information.</p>
          <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
          <p>Technically, I am only fetching news from my servers into the app through a secure HTTPS protocol. There is
            no data sent anywhere outside.</p>
          <p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p>
          <p>This app contains many links to other sites. I have taken utmost care in ensuring that I am indexing
            content only from good quality sources, because I use this app myself.</p>
          <p>When I find a content provider not following good security policies, I immediately blacklist them.</p>
          <p>
            If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are
            not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have
            no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy
            policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Childrenâ€™s Privacy</strong></p>
          <p>There is nothing in this app for kids below 13 years of age.</p>
          <p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p>
          <p>I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time but the core purpose of this app will remain same
            forever, this is, never collect any user data.</p>
          <p>This policy is effective as of 2023-03-15</p>
